# Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Mobile App for Academic Credential Verification

A comprehensive mobile application implementing W3C standards for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials with selective disclosure capabilities using BBS+ signatures.

## Background

Traditional academic credential verification requires sharing entire transcripts and relying on centralized authorities, creating privacy risks and inefficiencies. This SSI mobile app empowers students to control their identity and selectively share academic credentials without revealing unnecessary personal information.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Technology Stack Decision**
> 
> I'm proposing a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** approach instead of a native mobile app for the following reasons:
> 1. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on iOS, Android, and desktop with a single codebase
> 2. **No app store requirements**: Can be installed directly from the browser
> 3. **Easier development and testing**: Can test locally on desktop and mobile browsers
> 4. **Modern capabilities**: PWAs support camera access, offline storage, notifications, and can be installed on home screens
> 5. **Better for demonstration**: Easier to showcase and distribute
> 
> The app will be built using:
> - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (vanilla) for maximum flexibility
> - **Web Crypto API** for cryptographic operations
> - **IndexedDB** for encrypted local storage
> - **Service Workers** for offline functionality
> 
> If you prefer a native mobile framework like React Native or Flutter instead, please let me know!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DID Method Selection**
> 
> For this implementation, I'm proposing **`did:key`** method for the following reasons:
> 1. **No blockchain required**: DIDs are generated directly from cryptographic key pairs
> 2. **Fully decentralized**: No dependency on external ledgers or registries
> 3. **Simple implementation**: Perfect for demonstration and educational purposes
> 4. **Offline-capable**: DIDs can be created and resolved without internet connectivity
> 5. **W3C compliant**: Follows all W3C DID standards
> 
> For production use, you might consider `did:web` (DNS-based) or `did:ion` (Bitcoin-anchored) for better verifiability and trust. Please confirm if `did:key` works for your use case.

> [!WARNING]
> **Cryptographic Library Constraints**
> 
> BBS+ signatures require specialized cryptographic libraries. While the Web Crypto API provides standard operations, BBS+ is not natively supported. I'll implement a simplified selective disclosure mechanism using:
> - **SHA-256 hashing** for commitment schemes
> - **ECDSA signatures** for credential signing
> - **Zero-knowledge proof simulation** for selective attribute disclosure
> 
> For production-grade BBS+ signatures, you'd need to integrate specialized libraries (e.g., `@mattrglobal/bbs-signatures`), which may require Node.js or WASM compilation.
